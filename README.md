blood_pressure
==============

A project of smart blood pressure with data-share function by Bluetooth

Steps to set up this project(no order):
0.make "use case" clear
1.PWM LED
2.ADC data acquisition(pressure,heartbeat and battery)
4.LCD drive through SPI1
5.EM9301 through SPI0
6.RDA5876 through UART0
7.EEPROM through I2C1
8.UART2 and I2C0 reserved
9.USB charger/upgrade/UDisk
